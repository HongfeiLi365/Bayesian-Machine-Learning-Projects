# Bayesian-Machine-Learning-Projects
Projects I did for STAT 578 Bayesian Machine Learning at UIUC

**Topic Modeling Using Bayesian Methods**
+ Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation with variational EM algorithm for topic modeling
+ Used a Support Vector Machine to classify documents based on latent features 

**Bayesian Optimization**
+ Used Bayesian Optimization to tune hyperparameters of a random forest model
