# Latent Dirichlet Allocation with EM Algorithm

This is a course project I did for Bayesian Machine Learning in 2018 spring at UIUC.

I implemented LDA with variational EM algorithm for topic modeling in Python.

I then use the latent features with a Support Vector Machine for document classification.
